This plugin provides a command for inserting time trackers: `Timekeep: Insert Tracker`. Alternatively, a timekeep can be created by creating a codeblock like the following:

````
```timekeep

```
````

## ✏️ Editing & Deleting

If you accidentally gave a block an incorrect name or started the timer late, you can use the editing feature to update the stored data or delete the entry.

## 👀 How its stored

This plugin is heavily inspired by [ObsidianSimpleTimeTracker](https://github.com/Ellpeck/ObsidianSimpleTimeTracker) (semi backwards compatible; some simple-time-tracker blocks can be renamed to timekeep), so the data for time tracking is stored as JSON within the `timekeep` code block.

The time block start and stop times are stored as timestamps, making it possible for you to start your time tracker, then close Obsidian and have the tracking continue when you open it again.

Below is an example of how this is stored:

```json
{"entries":[{"name":"Example Time Block","startTime":"2024-03-17T06:32:36.118Z","endTime":"2024-03-17T06:32:37.012Z","subEntries":null}]}
```


## 📝 Export Formats

Below are the various formats that timekeeping data can be exported to:

### Markdown Table


| Block              | Start time        | End time          | Duration |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| Example Time Block | 24-03-17 19:32:36 | 24-03-17 19:32:37 | 0s       |
| **Total**          |                   |                   | **0s**   |


```md
| Block              | Start time        | End time          | Duration |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| Example Time Block | 24-03-17 19:32:36 | 24-03-17 19:32:37 | 0s       |
| **Total**          |                   |                   | **0s**   |
```

### CSV

```csv
Block,Start time,End time,Duration
Example Time Block,24-03-17 19:32:36,24-03-17 19:32:37,0s
```

> [!NOTE]
> In the plugin settings, you can choose to omit the first line of the CSV containing the column names:


### JSON

The JSON export format simply copies the JSON stored inside the timekeep:

```json
{"entries":[{"name":"Example Time Block","startTime":"2024-03-17T06:32:36.118Z","endTime":"2024-03-17T06:32:37.012Z","subEntries":null}]}
```

### Generated PDFs

Below is an example of a PDF generated by Timekeep. These PDFs are generated using react-pdf locally.
